# Project Tea Data Set Analysis
## Business Case
1. Exploratory analysis of tea auction and export data to get more business intelligence about the process. 
2.  Compare rainfall data with tea auction data to consider a correlation between the two. 

## Objectives for Tea Auction and Export Data
 - How does ESWARAN BROTHERS compare against other buyers by size and mix of purchases?
 - Are ESWARAN BROTHERS purchasing efficiently for their purchasing profile?
 - Are there any trends that can be discerned from the data?
 - How does ESWARAN BROTHERS compare against other exports by size and mix of purchases? This will only be done for teabags.
 - Country analysis. Who are the biggest purchases?
 - How do countries purchasing prices differ from each other?

Data
